* Use Entra ID Governance to create and grant access to applications using access packages  
* Provide access to resources to external users (guests) using Access Packages with Entra Verified ID

* Create proper conditional access policies to control and scope to groups of enforcement
* Confirm that traffic is appropriately granted with traffic logs with test users

## Next Steps

* Compile a comprehensive report on POC results.
* Recommendations for full-scale implementation based on POC findings
* Outline a timeline and resource plan for deployment.
